# Core Delivery Channel Simulation Design for .url Files

This document outlines the conceptual design for simulating the delivery mechanisms of `.url` files through common internal communication channels. The focus is on how these files would conceptually reach target systems, not on user interaction with the files post-delivery.

## Simulated Delivery Channels

Two primary channels are considered for this simulation design:

1.  **Email Attachments:**
    *   **Concept:** Simulate the delivery of a `.url` file as an attachment to an email.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   A test email would be crafted.
        *   The `.url` file (as designed in Task D.1) would be attached to this email.
        *   The email would be "sent" to a simulated recipient inbox or monitored email gateway.
    *   **Scope:** The simulation focuses on the arrival of the email with the `.url` attachment in the target environment. It does not cover the user opening the email or the attachment.

2.  **Shared Drive Links / Placement:**
    *   **Concept:** Simulate the placement of a `.url` file on a shared network drive or collaboration platform, making it accessible to target users.
    *   **Mechanism:**
        *   A designated network share or a folder within a collaboration tool (e.g., SharePoint, network drive) would be identified as the "drop zone."
        *   The `.url` file would be programmatically or manually placed into this designated location.
        *   Optionally, a notification or link (not the `.url` file itself, but a pointer to its location) could be disseminated via another channel (e.g., an instant message or a separate email) informing users of the file's availability.
    *   **Scope:** The simulation focuses on the presence of the `.url` file in the shared location. It does not cover users navigating to or interacting with the file in that location.

## Exclusions

This design phase explicitly excludes:
*   User interaction with the delivered `.url` file (e.g., clicking, opening).
*   The payload or effect of the `.url` file itself upon activation.
*   Detailed simulation of email server infrastructure or complex network topologies. The focus is on the endpoint delivery.

The primary goal is to establish how a `.url` file, as a container, can be transmitted or made available within a typical internal corporate environment.
