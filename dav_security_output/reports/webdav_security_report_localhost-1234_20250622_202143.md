## General Security Recommendations
- Ensure WebDAV servers are patched and up-to-date.
- Implement strict authentication and authorization controls for WebDAV access.
- If anonymous write access is enabled, carefully monitor uploaded content and restrict executable file types.
- Configure Content Security Policy (CSP) headers on any web applications that might serve or reference content from this WebDAV server, especially for SVG and HTML-like content.
- Use `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` header to prevent browsers from MIME-sniffing responses.
- For files like SVG and CSS, if they are user-supplied, consider server-side sanitization or serving them with a restrictive Content-Type (e.g., `text/plain`) if their active content is not required.
- Regularly audit WebDAV directories for unauthorized or suspicious files.
